For the CPE 400 final project, our group's project was on project idea 4: Dynamic routing mechanism design in faulty network
The project we have created provides a simulation of routing and routing failures in an unstable environment using the DSR protocol,
specifically focusing on its capabilities to cache routes and how the cached routes may not always provide a valid route in an unstable 
environment.

The simulation can be run in 'simulation.py'. The probability_of_link_failure field can be changed as needed (Range: 0 to 1).
The graph can topology of the network can also be changed as needed, and a test_networks.txt file has a couple test scenarios already provided.
The simulation outputs when packets are successfully transmitted, which links break, and also the numbers of successful packet and unsuccessful
packet transmissions.
